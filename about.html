      <p>Serial Knitters is really about building a community for folks who are interested in knitting, are experienced or beginner knitters, or just like look at knitting projects. We want to create a welcoming, opening space for anyone to show us their knitting projects. Serial Knitters is a safe space for anyone to enjoy the art of knitting as a whole. There's a generalization amongst the public that only grannies knit, however at Serial Knitters we want anyone to knit (also who doesn't want to be as skilled as a granny who knits?).  </p>

      <p><em>"Wow, this community sounds so fun! But wait, where did the name Serial Knitters come from?"</p></em>
      <p>Insert millenial generalization right here: yes, Serial Knitters is a pun on Serial Killers. Yes, we have a fascination with serial killers and knitting so why not fuse it into one world? JUST KIDDING!</p>
      <p><em>"Wow that was dark, but I'm still stoked! How do I contribute to the Serial Knitters community?"</p></em>
      <p> We want Serial Knitters to be an open arm community to anyone who wants to celebrate the wonderful world of knitting. This is a judgment free zone, meaning no question is too much, no project is not enough, and just be your true authentic self. We do want to make sure Serial Knitters remains a fun, open community, meaning we won’t tolerate any hate in our community. Once we open Serial Knitters in its entirety we hope to have message boards, how-to videos, and in-person meetups. If you would like to host or be a moderator for any of these, please reach out to us. Also, don’t be sad crochet fans out there, we welcome you too!</p>
      <p>So come grab you knitting needles, a fresh skeine, and join us on this crazy knitting journey! We hope to inspire great conversations and friendships around knitting. Our hope is to have everyone feel proud that they are knitters and have found community within their hobby or knitting lifestyle. Thank you everyone who has helped make this a great place to knit!</p>

        <h2>Wait, Who Are You Though?!</h2>
        <p>I'm Lindsey Macias Saltz, an Online Marketing Specialist based in the Bay Area. My knitting journey started when I was planning my wedding. I hated planning a wedding and needed a hobby to get my mind off all the stress and chaos. I knew how to sew already, but wanted a hobby that I could throw in a bag and take with me anywhere. Knitting fit this perfectly! I had one ball of yarn and just kept teaching myself how to cast on and off until I got it down. Now a few years later I knit during meetings, on the go, and whenever I can sneak in a new project! </p>
        <p>This song is also dedicated to all my fellow Serial Knitters, hope you have Big Energy while working on your project!</p>
