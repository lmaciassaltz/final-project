    <h3>That's Dope, But What Is Knitting Exactly?</h3>
    <p>Knitting is a method by which yarn is manipulated to create a textile, or fabric. It is used to create many types of garments. Knitting may be done by hand or by machine.</p>
    <p>Knitting creates stitches: loops of yarn in a row, either flat or in the roung (tubular needles with wire in between). There are usually many active stitches on the knitting needle at one time. Knitted fabric consists of a number of consectuive rows of connected loops that intermesh with the next and previous rows. As each row is formed, each newly created loop is pulled through one of more loops from the prior row and placed on the gaining needle so tha the loops from the prior row can be pulled off the other needle without unraveling.</p>
